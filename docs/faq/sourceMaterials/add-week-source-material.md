# Add Week to Source Materials

You may choose between the three methods below to add week to the source materials data:

### Add week manually

You can always add a week to the source materials, even if you are offline. To do so, go to the Dashboard page, and then under Source Material card, click **Add New Week.** Please note however that it is very time consuming to add the information needed for each item.

### Add weeks using an EPUB file

You can add multiple weeks at once to the source materials, even if you are offline, and there is no need to enter each week details one by one. To do so, go to the Dashboard page, and then under Source Material card, click **Import from EPUB file.** Please note however that the file you import must be the exact file and naming of the EPUB file from JW.ORG.

### Add weeks from JW.ORG

When you are online, you can add multiple weeks at once to the source materials. New schedules available on jw.org are automatically added. To do so, go to the Dashboard page, and then under Source Material card, click **Import from JW.ORG.**
